Calling bulls in close can be difficult.  Every situation can be different.  Elk are very unpredictable and a hunter must react fast. Pressuring the bull is a necessity about 80% of the time.  Concentrate on calling the bull in the last 75 to 150 yards.  

Here is a typical scenario.  Once I have a bull respond to my bugle, I try to work them in the same way every time. First I move in the direction that the bull is answering from.  It never hurts not to answer him immediately.  Next I bugle, trying to pinpoint the bull’s location.  If the bull starts moving toward you, set up.  If this doesn’t happen, move toward him.  If the bull bugles on his own, don’t call and let him set the tempo.  Each time the bull bugles, I like to move one-third of the distance to the bull and then set up.  On my final set up I try to get on the same level or lower than the bull always remembering to keep the wind in my face at all times.  Try to anticipate the trail that the bull will come in on.  I start my calling with a few cow mews.  If there is no response, bugle and grunt.  If he then seems closer, stay put.  If not, move up closer. Don’t worry about crashing brush, as long as the sounds are natural. At this point, you should be in the bull’s backyard.  The closer you get by pressuring the bull, the better your chances are of making the bull react to your call.  My goal is to get as close to the bull as possible with making the least amount of calls. I’ve called bulls in with as little as 4 or 5 cow calls.

Every year there are a few days when bulls become extremely aggressive.  From the time you make a call, a bull can travel hundreds of yards in just a few short minutes.  Be careful never to bugle unless you’re ready for action.
